# The "unofficial" unofficial SU Speedrunning Wiki

## What is this place for?

This wiki is intended to document the technical side of Sonic Unleashed (HD). While the main speedrunning glitches are well documented at this point, there is still much that is not fully documented or is spread across multiple areas.

While I've named this place the "speedrunning" wiki I am aiming to document all technical knowledge of Sonic Unleashed, even if it doesn't seem to have a inherent benefit to speedrunning.

This Wiki is completely [opensource](https://github.com/NaomiTheAshenOne/sonic-unleashed-wiki) and has a Creative Commons license, meaning that this will always be in the community's hands and no one person has ownership over it.

## How do I contribute?

If you want to edit the content on a page you can scroll to the bottom, click "Edit this page" and once you've made your changes submit a Pull Request on the github repository. I'm using github to manage the edits to the wiki as it allows for changes to be peer reviewed before getting merged helping reduce misinfomation and griefing from occurring. If you don't want to use github pull requests feel free to leave a github issue with your changes or DM them to me on discord @naomi.the.ashen.one

This wiki is built with [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the [Hugo-book](https://github.com/alex-shpak/hugo-book) theme. This means that instead of writing in HTML, our content is written with [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) which is an easy to pickup text format. I have setup github actions on the wiki's repo that will automatically recompile and publish the site after any change is made to the repository.
